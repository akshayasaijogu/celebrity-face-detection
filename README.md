##Celebrity Face Detection Project
Welcome to the Celebrity Face Detection project! This project represents the culmination of weeks of dedicated effort and learning in the Python for Data Science Bootcamp. Below is an overview of the project's key components and achievements:

##Overview
Exploring Celebrity Face Detection and Recognition
In this project, we delve into the fascinating realm of celebrity face detection and recognition. Using a combination of advanced techniques and state-of-the-art algorithms, we have developed a robust system capable of identifying celebrities' faces with precision.

##Key Components
-->Data Preparation
    Our journey began with the meticulous curation of a diverse and relevant celebrity dataset.
    Employing a combination of manual curation and code-based techniques, we ensured the data's impeccable quality and consistency.
-->Facial Feature Extraction
    Leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as Haarcascades, we implemented face and eye detection.
    Through precise cropping and segmentation, we isolated facial features with accuracy, laying the foundation for reliable recognition.
-->Feature Engineering and Wavelet Transform
    Advancing our approach with sophisticated feature engineering, we ventured into wavelet transforms.
    By harnessing the power of wavelets, we extracted rich, multi-dimensional features, capturing each celebrity's distinctive essence.
-->Model Training and Optimization
    Armed with a rich dataset and feature-rich images, we embarked on model training.
    Employing a diverse ensemble of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, each model underwent meticulous fine-tuning for optimal performance.
    Hyperparameter tuning, facilitated by GridSearchCV, further refined model accuracy, ensuring resilience across diverse scenarios.
-->Streamlit Interface Development
    With a focus on accessibility and user-friendliness, we crafted an intuitive Streamlit interface.
    Users can effortlessly explore the wonders of facial recognition firsthand, experiencing the capabilities of cutting-edge computer vision technology.
